# Terms of Use

## Main
By downloading or using the `Knowl - Words quiz | 5words10seconds` app, you automatically agree to these terms, so we strongly encourage you to read them carefully before proceeding. Although the source code is open, I kindly request that you do not copy, modify, or redistribute the app without acknowledging me as the author and notifying me. Additionally, please do not use the names, trademarks, or images created by me without permission. All intellectual property rights, including trademarks, copyrights, and database rights, remain the sole property of `Heorhii Savoiskyi`.

`Heorhii Savoiskyi` is dedicated to making the app as functional and effective as possible. As part of this commitment, we reserve the right to modify the app or impose charges for its services, at any time and for any reason. Rest assured, we will always clearly communicate any fees before they apply to you.

**The `Knowl - Words quiz | 5words10seconds` app does not collect, store, or process any personal data.** There are no account systems, no user authentication, and no marketing data collection. The app does not require you to provide any personal information to function. Any data used for functionality is either stored on your device or managed by Apple’s own system for managing app performance and errors, as described below.

Keeping your phone and access to the app secure is your responsibility. We strongly recommend against jailbreaking or rooting your device, as this could remove essential security protections, expose your device to malware, and prevent the `Knowl - Words quiz | 5words10seconds` app from functioning properly.

Currently, we do not incorporate third-party services into the app. However, this may change in the future if we decide to integrate such services. Any such updates will be clearly communicated.

Please note, there are certain limitations to our responsibility. The app may require an active internet connection, which can either be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network. `Heorhii Savoiskyi` is not responsible for the app's reduced functionality if you lack access to Wi-Fi or have depleted your mobile data allowance.

When using the app outside a Wi-Fi zone, the terms of your agreement with your mobile network provider still apply. This could result in data charges, including roaming charges if you're outside your home region. By using the app, you accept any associated costs. If you are not the bill payer, we assume you have obtained permission from the account holder.

Similarly, `Heorhii Savoiskyi` cannot be held accountable for issues arising from user actions, such as a depleted device battery, which may prevent you from accessing the app.

`Heorhii Savoiskyi` does not accept liability for any direct or indirect loss that may result from relying on the app's functions.

At times, updates to the app may be necessary. The app currently supports iOS 17+, and system requirements may evolve. If you wish to continue using the app, you’ll need to install these updates when available. `Heorhii Savoiskyi` does not guarantee that the app will remain compatible with your device’s software, and you agree to install all updates provided. We may also discontinue the app at any time, and upon termination, all rights granted to you will be revoked, and you must uninstall the app from your device.

## Changes to the Terms of Use
We may periodically update these Terms of Use, and you are encouraged to check this page regularly. Any changes will be posted here, and we will notify you about significant updates.
