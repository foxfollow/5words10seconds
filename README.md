Board game

## About
The game was developed by an iOS developer. I was inspired by a board card game named [Настільна гра Strateg Встигни за 10 секунд / Board game Strateg Make it in 10 seconds](https://strateg.ua/en/nastolnaya-igra-uspey-za-10-sekund-ukr-1), which was made by the Ukrainian company [Strateg](https://strateg.ua/en).

### Try it on iOS
It's totally free!

In the future, you could buy a coffee for the developer, or even now, I would be infinitely grateful if you could support Ukraine by clicking on [Donate to Serhiy Prytula Charity Foundation](https://prytulafoundation.org/en/donation).
